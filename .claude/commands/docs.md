description: Search Hex documentation for project dependencies
---

Use the HexDocs MCP server to search for documentation. Ask the user what they want to search for, then use `mcp__hexdocs__search` or `mcp__tidewave__search_package_docs` to find relevant documentation.

Remember to fetch package docs first if needed with `mcp__hexdocs__fetch` before searching.
