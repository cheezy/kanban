  "systemMessage": "You are working with the Stride task management system.\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n\n1. Never specify identifiers when creating tasks (auto-generated as G1, W47, D12)\n2. verification_steps must be array of objects with step_type, step_text, expected_result, position\n3. testing_strategy fields (unit_tests, integration_tests, manual_tests) must be arrays\n4. type must be exactly 'work', 'defect', or 'goal' as strings\n5. Execute after_doing hook BEFORE calling complete endpoint\n\nHOOK EXECUTION:\nStride has four client-side hooks:\n- before_doing (60s, blocking) - Before starting work\n- after_doing (120s, blocking) - After work, BEFORE calling complete endpoint\n- before_review (60s, non-blocking) - When entering review\n- after_review (60s, non-blocking) - After approval\n\nBlocking hooks must succeed for workflow to continue.\n\nESSENTIAL TASK FIELDS:\nRequired: type, title\nCritical: key_files, dependencies, verification_steps, testing_strategy\nRecommended: description, complexity, priority, needs_review, pitfalls, patterns_to_follow, acceptance_criteria\n\nCOMPLETION ORDER:\n1. Finish work\n2. Execute after_doing hook (tests, lint, build)\n3. Only if hook succeeds, call PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete\n4. Execute before_review hook (non-blocking)\n\nBATCH CREATION:\nRoot key must be 'goals' (not 'tasks'). Dependencies within goals use array indices [0, 1]. Cross-goal dependencies don't work in batch.\n\nDOCUMENTATION:\n- Onboarding: https://www.stridelikeaboss.com/api/agent/onboarding\n- Task Writing: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheezy/kanban/refs/heads/main/docs/TASK-WRITING-GUIDE.md\n- API Reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheezy/kanban/refs/heads/main/docs/api/README.md\n\nNOTE: For comprehensive workflow enforcement, Claude Code users should install the four Stride Skills from the onboarding endpoint.",
