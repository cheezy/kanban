defmodule Kanban.Tasks.GoalCompletion do
  @moduledoc """
  Transactional last-child-completion detection for parent goals.

  Provides the building block for the after_goal hook protocol (G113):
  given a child task being completed, atomically transition the child to
  `:completed` and determine whether this completion is the final
  remaining child of its parent goal. Concurrent sibling completions are
  serialized by a row-level `FOR UPDATE` lock on the parent goal, so
  exactly one completion sees `:last_child` — even if many siblings call
  this function simultaneously.

  Downstream wiring is owned by sibling tasks; this module is the
  serialization primitive they sit on top of:

  * W491 — wire `after_goal` into the completion endpoint response when
    `:last_child` is detected
  * W492 — same for `mark_reviewed`
  * W493 — gate the parent goal's Done transition on the agent-reported
    after_goal exit code (this is why `finalize_child_and_check_goal_complete/2`
    does NOT itself mark the parent goal `:completed` — promotion is
    deferred until the agent confirms `after_goal` exited 0).

  Atomically transition `child` to `:completed` and determine whether the
  transition finished the parent goal.

  Wraps two operations in a single `Ecto.Multi`:

    1. Update the child task with the merged `attrs` (defaults to
       `status: :completed` + `completed_at: utc_now`).
    2. If the child has a parent goal, row-lock the parent (`SELECT ...
       FOR UPDATE`), then count siblings whose `status != :completed`.

  Returns `{:ok, :last_child}` when the parent goal exists and zero
  siblings remain incomplete after this transition; returns
  `{:ok, :not_last_child}` otherwise — including the cases where the
  task has no parent (`parent_id` is nil) or the parent is not of type
  `:goal`. Returns the standard `{:error, step, value, changes_so_far}`
  shape on transaction failure.

  Concurrent calls for siblings of the same parent goal are serialized
  by the parent-goal row lock: only one transaction can hold the lock at
  a time, so each sees a consistent view of the remaining-incomplete
  count when it computes `:last_child` vs `:not_last_child`. The result
  is unambiguous — duplicate `:last_child` returns are not possible.

  Accepts `attrs` as either a map or keyword list; missing `:status` and
  `:completed_at` keys default to `:completed` / `DateTime.utc_now/0`.

  Same transition as `finalize_child_and_check_goal_complete/2`, but also
  returns the id of the goal this call completed.

  The third element is the parent goal's id only when this call's
  compare-and-set flipped the goal's `after_goal_status` from `nil` to
  `:pending`, and `nil` otherwise. `after_goal_status` never returns to
  `nil`, so at most one call per goal ever returns its id — a sibling that is
  re-opened and re-completed still gets `:last_child`, but `nil` here. That
  makes the id the exactly-once signal for `[:kanban, :goal, :completed]`,
  which the caller passes to `Kanban.Tasks.GoalTelemetry.completed/2` once its
  outermost transaction has committed.
