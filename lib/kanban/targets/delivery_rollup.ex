defmodule Kanban.Targets.DeliveryRollup do
  @moduledoc """
  Read-only bridge from the agent roster to the delivery targets.

  This is the data foundation for the Phase 2 delivery-centric views: it
  connects each active agent to the delivery target it is contributing toward
  by walking the chain

      agent -> its tasks -> parent goal -> goal's target

  and produces, for every target the caller can access, the derived
  `Kanban.Targets.Status`, the target's member goals, the agents active on it,
  and the goals and agents that have stalled.

  ## What "active on a target" means

  An agent is active on a target when at least one of the agent's tasks (a task
  it created or completed) has a parent goal assigned to that target. A single
  agent can be active on several targets at once — it appears under each.

  ## Agents outside the rollup

  An agent whose tasks never reach a target — because they have no parent goal,
  or the parent goal is not assigned to any target — is not attributed to any
  target.

  The task fetch is bounded to target-bridged tasks (tasks whose parent goal is
  assigned to a target) so the /agents load stays within the database statement
  timeout at production scale (D122). A consequence of that bound is that agents
  whose work never reaches a target are not fetched at all, so `:unrolled_agents`
  is always `[]`. The key is retained in the return shape for API stability; it
  is not currently rendered by any caller.

  ## Stalled goals and agents

  "Stalled" reuses the agent roster's classification wholesale: an agent is
  stalled when it is `stuck` (holding an active task past the stuck threshold)
  OR `dormant` (no activity past the dormancy threshold). A member goal is
  stalled when at least one stalled agent is active on it. The rollup never
  re-implements stuck/dormant detection — it reads the flags
  `Kanban.Agents.Roster` already derived.

  ## Scoping / security

  Every read is board-scoped to `scope`. The task set comes from
  `Kanban.Agents.fetch_tasks/1` (board-scoped, goal-excluded), the targets and
  their member goals come from `Kanban.Targets` (board-scoped), and the
  agent->goal->target bridge is derived purely in memory from that already
  board-scoped data — so no target, goal, agent, or status from an inaccessible
  board can leak into the rollup.

  ## Purity / time injection

  `today` (for status derivation) and `timezone` (for the roster's stuck/dormant
  clock) are injected at this impure boundary — `today` defaults to the local
  day in `timezone`. The pure derivation is deterministic and testable by
  passing an explicit `today`.

    * `:timezone` — IANA zone anchoring the roster's stuck/dormant clock and the
      default `today` (default `"Etc/UTC"`).
    * `:today` — the `Date` used for status derivation (default: the local day
