              This application was created by <b>Tango</b>, together with our AI-powered virtual team member, <b>Claudete</b>.
              </br></br>
              Tango is a Canada-based software company focused on building modern, scalable digital products by combining cutting-edge technology with AI-assisted development. We help organizations move faster, build smarter, and deliver higher-quality software without unnecessary complexity.
              </br></br>
              <b>Claudete</b> was born from our hands-on work with two AI tools — <b>Claude Code</b> and <b>Tidewave</b>. Their combined strengths evolved into a collaborative virtual team member that works alongside our developers, accelerating delivery while maintaining precision and quality.
              </br></br>
              What began as an internal learning journey—exploring the real-world potential of AI-assisted development—quickly became something more. As we experienced the impact firsthand, we realized how powerful it is to put AI directly into the hands of experienced engineers. The results reshaped how we think about software delivery.
              </br></br>
              We saw possibilities not just for startups, but for development teams of any size—across private and public sectors, and in virtually any industry.
              </br></br>
              While many large organizations attempt to improve outcomes by measuring productivity, our experience shows that true gains come from <i>speed</i>, <i>accuracy</i>, and <i>quality</i>. With AI as a true collaborator, those metrics are no longer incremental—they're transformed.
